# What’s next? The Swiss Pharmaceutical Industry in the International Innovation Race

This repository contains the code for an interactive report about the international innovation race in pharmaceuticals. In particualr, we use machine learning to assess the value of recently published patents and investigate the quality of the innovation pipeline of countries, clusters and companies. The full article can be accessed <a href = https://www.innoscape.de/pharma_pred/innovation_pharma.html target = “_blank”>*here*</a>.

According to our predictions, the U.S. and its main clusters MT, CA or CT maintain a strong position and are home to many of the most promising startups. But also Swiss clusters of Northwestern Switzerland and the Lake Geneva region are among the most innovative pharmaceutical clusters worldwide. Finally, China has steadily improved its pharmaceutical innovation pipeline, but its companies - and especially startups - do not seem to play in the top innovation league (yet).

This report is part of <a href = http://innoscape.ch/ target = “_blank”>*Innoscape*</a>, an applied research project of the <a href = https://cieb.unibas.ch target = “_blank”>Center for International Economics and Business | CIEB</a> at the University of Basel. With *Innoscape*, we analyze how well prepared the Swiss economy is for the transformations of the 21st century. We provide economic insights on how Switzerland can successfully master these challenges and discuss how the country could remain a global innovation leader in the future.
